## About
The Multigolf game is a website-based game that let's you play and design minigolf courses by combining multiple phone screens.

## Project Structure

The website is split into three parts:

1. the [Welcome page](https://github.com/noel-friedrich/multigolf/tree/main/welcome)
    - This is the main landing page and will let people navigate to creating or joining active games.
2. the [Setup page](https://github.com/noel-friedrich/multigolf/tree/main/setup)
    - This is where you start a new game session. You may configure the game and let other devices join the course.
3. the [Join page](https://github.com/noel-friedrich/multigolf/tree/main/join)
    - This is where new devices joining the game will direct to.
4. the [Game page](https://github.com/noel-friedrich/multigolf/tree/main/game)
    - This is where the game is actually being played. You'll be playing the configured minigame course and the scores will decide who the best multigolfer is.
